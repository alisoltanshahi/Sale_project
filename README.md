# Sales_Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data using SQL and Python. The data is processed and visualized to uncover insights about sales performance, trends, and patterns. The project is divided into different components, each serving a specific purpose in the analysis pipeline.

## Components

### SQL Database Setup and Queries
The SQL script `sale_project.sql` sets up the database and performs various queries to extract meaningful information from the sales data. Key operations include:

- **Database Setup:** Creating tables and importing data.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
- **Analytical Queries:** Extracting insights on sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.

### Jupyter Notebook Analysis
The Jupyter Notebook `Sale_project.ipynb` contains the Python code for data analysis and visualization. Key sections include:

- **Data Loading:** Importing the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Exploration:** Summarizing and exploring the dataset.
- **Visualization:** Creating charts and graphs to visualize sales trends and patterns.

### CSV Data
The CSV file `Updated_Sales_p.csv` contains the raw sales data used for analysis. It includes fields such as transaction ID, date, customer ID, product ID, quantity, and sales amount.

## Tableau Public Dashboard
The results of the analysis are also presented in an interactive dashboard on Tableau Public. You can explore the visualizations and gain insights from the data by visiting the following link:
